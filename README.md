# WinLabeler

The easiest way to create your own custom Windows folder icons.

## ðŸš§ In development ðŸš§

This project is still in development. **But there is already a working prototype.**

## How to use

First install Wand:

```bash
pip install Wand
```

Then, run the script:

```bash
python winLabeler.py --path "C:\Users\User\example.png" small
```

```bash
python winLabeler.py --path "C:\Users\User\summer_photos\example.png" large
```

Finally, the icon should be in the root folder of the project with the name `out.ico`.

> âš  Expect some bugs. This is sill a **proof of concept**.
